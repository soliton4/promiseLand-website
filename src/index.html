      <div class="featurehead"><span class="enumeration resolved">*</span>promiseLand &#x2283; javaScript strict mode (for the most part)</div>
      <div class="featurebody readMore">
        Dont learn a new Programming Language. PromiseLand includes javaScript strict mode.
        <div class="more">PromiseLand is basically javaScript. For the most existing javaScript there will be no noticable difference in the way it executes.<br> If you dont use any of the promiseLand features, the promiseLand Compiler will generate basic javaScript. The most important difference is that promiseLand requires a Module Loader. A commonJs and AMD compatible header and footer is added to your code. The Module is expected as a return statement.
          <textarea class="promiseLandCode">
var a;
var b = 1;
var c = "value";
var d = undefinedVariable;    // will not cause error

return {                      // the module is defined by return
  a: a,
  b: b,
  c: c,
  d: d
};

thisCodeIsNotBeingExecuted(); // since it is behind a return statement.

      <div class="featurehead"><span class="enumeration resolved">*</span>*promise</div>
      <div class="featurebody readMore">Dereference promises with the * operator.
        <div class="more">If you know c or c++ you will be familliar with the dereferencing operator.<br>"*" used as a unary operator in front of an expression, is called dereferencing. Instead of the promise Object, it returns the result of a promise. If the promise is not fullfilled yet the code will wait on that position until the promise is fullfilled. If the promise is rejected, the reject reason will be thrown as an exception.<br>
      Imagine writing your asynchron code in a seemingliy synchronous manner.
          <textarea class="promiseLandCode">
var p = new Promise();
setTimeout(function(){
  p.resolve("resolved Value");
}, 1000);

var result = *p; // this will wait until the timeout has happened

var p2 = new Promise();
setTimeout(function(){
  p.reject("reject reason");
}, 1000);

try {
  var result2 = *p2;
}catch(e){
  console.log(*p + " / " + e); // you can dereference promises anywhere
                               // this will output "resolved value / reject reason"
};
          </textarea>
          <br>
          Functions that make use of the dereferencing promise mechanism will allways return a promise themselves. You can force the return of a promise by adding the promise operator to the function definition.
          <textarea class="promiseLandCode">
var f1 = function(){
  if (false){
    *someNonExistenPromise; // dereferencing code that is actually not being called.

var f2 = function()*{       // explicitly mark the function as promising
  return "result 2";
};

var finalResult = *f1() + " / " + *f2(); // both functions will return a promise.
                                         // the final result is "result 1 / result 2"

      <div class="featurebody readMore">The function keyword is optional. <div class="more">One of the goals of promiseLand is to prevent unneccessary type work. Since the function keyword is clearly not neccessary to identyfy a function, you can simply leave it away. a small but powerful feature.

      </div>

      <div class="featurehead"><span class="enumeration resolved">*</span>require "modulename"</div>
      <div class="featurebody readMore">The keyword require can be used to load modules.
        <div class="more">PromiseLand assumes that a module loader is in use. There is limited functionality available in order to make a promiseLand module work without a loder, but the regular usecase is that you use eather commonJs (node.js) or AMD (require.js).<br>
          A module loader is being added that is compatible with both. You can load modules simply like this:
          <textarea class="promiseLandCode">
var module = require "path/to/module";
var relativeModule = require "./relative/module";
          </textarea>
          
          require has to work if its used in AMD or commonJs environment. Therefore require is treated as a asynchron statement, similar to promise dereferencing. Functions that make use of require will return a promise
        
          <textarea class="promiseLandCode">
var f = (){
  var m = require "some/module"  // makes the funciton promising
  return "result";
};

console.log(*f());  // will output "result"
          </textarea>
        </div></div>

      <div class="featurehead"><span class="enumeration resolved">*</span>catch them all</div>
      <div class="featurebody readMore">error handling is completely transparent over assynchron code. <div class="more">A rejected promise is treated as an exception. It can be catched the same way as regular javaScript exceptions.
        
          <textarea class="promiseLandCode">

setTimeout(function(){
  p.reject("reject reason");

  console.log(e);     // rejected promise causes a catchable exception when dereferenced
};
          </textarea>
        <br>
        Uncatched errors in promising Functions cause the resulting promise to be rejected.
        
          <textarea class="promiseLandCode">
var f = ()*{  // promising function
  throw { msg: "some error" }; // uncatched error will cause the resulting promise to be rejected.

      <div class="featurehead"><span class="enumeration resolved">*</span>"string<br>continuation"</div>
      <div class="featurebody readMore">Have you ever wondered why you can not use multiline string literals in javaScript? Well you are not alone.<div class="more">
        Strings can continue over line breaks:
          <textarea class="promiseLandCode">
var validString = "Some text
that goes on
over several lines";

      <div class="featurehead"><span class="enumeration progress">*</span>clientCode(); serverCode(); clientCode(); whereEverCode();</div>
      <div class="featurebody readMore">Different runtime environments can be addressed by "frame"-name.
        <div class="more">
          PromiseLand introduces the concept of execution frames. A frame addresses a certain configuration in which the code is executed. For example node.js, browser, browser worker thread or what ever runtime you choose for your code.<br>
          By adding frame information to a function, it allowes you to programm an execution flow accross all runtime environments.<br><br>
          exclusive:
          
          <textarea class="promiseLandCode">
var fs; // file system
var serverInit = () exclusive "server"{
  fs = require "fs";
};
serverInit();

          </textarea>
          The "exclusive" keyword makes the function run exclusively in one frame. If called from within another frame, it is simply not executed.<br><br>
          
          frame:
          <textarea class="promiseLandCode">
var fs; // file system
var serverInit = () exclusive "server"{
  fs = require "fs";
};
serverInit();

var readFile = (fileName) frame "server"{
  var cb = new Callback(); // read the callback section for details
  fs.readFile(fileName, cb);
  var args = *cb.promise;
  return args[1];
};

// this code works on server and on client
var someFun = (){
  console.log(*readFile("readme.txt")); // frame functions are allways promising
};
          </textarea>
          The frame name tells promiseLand in which frame the function will be executed.<br>
          In this example you can see a simple file reading function that will run on the client and on the server.<br>
          If called from the server it is simply executed. If called from the client, promiseLand communicates through the frame api to the other frame. The function will be executed on the choosen frame and the result is transfered back to the calling frame. This makes a frame function allways promising.<br>
          The frame name must be a string literal.<br><br>
          How does it work?<br>
          PromiseLand defines a very low level communication api. All you need to do is provide a frame Name, and implement a way those frames can send each other string messages. Read more on the frame wiki page. (tba)

      <div class="featurehead"><span class="enumeration progress">*</span>dynamic type safety</div>
      <div class="featurebody readMore">True freedom includes the freedom to choose, not to be free!<div class="more">Variables, Classes and Functions can be type safe if you want them to be. The typesafety is checked during compile time. Type Errors are being encoded as runtime Errors, to occur when a type violation is being executed. They are also available as warnings during compile time.
        
        <textarea class="promiseLandCode">
class type ClassA { // typesafety is indicated by the type keyword
  a: 1,
  b: 2
};

class type ClassB {
  c: 3,
  d: 4
};

var var1 = 1;
ClassA varA = new ClassA();
ClassA varB = new ClassA();

varA = varB; // will cause runtime error.
          </textarea>
        
        <br>
        The typesafe Classes can be used in variables by using the Type Name instead of the var keyword.
        The Type Name is part of a new layer of Language Elements: Types.<br>
        There is the build in Type "var" that is used for every classical javaScript variable. In addition you can create user defined types that exist parallel to the var keyword in the scope of the Type Definition.<br>
        Additionally there is a variable for each defined type that exists as a regular Variable of type "var". You can use this variable to address the Type programmatically.
        
        <textarea class="promiseLandCode">
class type ClassA { // typesafety is indicated by the type keyword
  a: 1,
  b: 2
};

var var1 = 1; // regular variable
ClassA varA;  // ClassA is available on the keyword level since it has been defined in this scope.
ClassA varA = new ClassA(); // the constructor of ClassA is returning a variable of type ClassA;

var typeVariable = ClassA;  // variable containing the Type information about ClassA;

return ClassA;              // you can return a Type in your Module, making it reuseable via require.
          </textarea>
        
        <br>
        Types can be exported and imported via require.<br>
        However in a script that imports the type the Type is not available on the keyword level yet. This is where the seperation of the Type information variable and the Type definition becomes relevant.
        You can use imported Types via templates. Yes allmost like c++ templates ;)
        
        <textarea class="promiseLandCode">
var classA = require "modulepath/ClassA"; // import the Type from above in a different module.

try{
  //classA varA = new classA(); // this wont compile since classA is not defined as type;
  var varA = new classA();      // there is no constructor available yet
}catch(e){};

var templateFun = &lt;{ types: { ClassA: classA } }&gt;(){ // template
  ClassA varA = new ClassA();
};

templateFun();

          </textarea>
        
        The Template is used to make compile time type safety available during run time. Since the Type information is not available during the compile time of the 2nd module, the final compilation happens at runtime. <br>
        The template function is being assembled at execution time via eval(). This may make the code definint the template function slower. Once the function exists it is as fast as any directly programmed function.<br>
        Class safety is programmed with execution time in mind. The defined Class Types are not using regular javaScript objects. Instead arrays are used which makes member lookup significantly faster. There is no data yet, but i hope typesafe Class variables will lead to measurable execution time boost.
        
        
        </div></div>

      <div class="featurehead"><span class="enumeration resolved">*</span>new Callback()</div>
      <div class="featurebody readMore">Use the Callback class to programm classically asynchron javaScript apis.<div class="more">
        <textarea class="promiseLandCode">var cb = new Callback();</textarea>
        This creates a function that will resolve a promise once it has been called.<br>
        You can pass it to a function that expects a callback. The member .promise is a Promise that resolves in a copy of the arguments Array.
        <textarea class="promiseLandCode">var fs = require "fs"; // node file system

var c = new Callback();

fs.readFile("filename.txt", c); // pass the callback as parameter
var args = *c.promise; // access the parameters via .promise

if (args[0]){
  console.log("error");
}else{
  console.log("success filecontent:");
  console.log(args[1]);</textarea>
        You could write your own Callback implementation that rejects when the node.js typical err argument is passed.

      <div class="featurebody readMore">This is aimed to use the Type safety feature to directly code asm.js<div class="more">transparent to the typesafety feature there will be a way to directly programm asm.js compatible code.

      <div class="featurehead"><span class="enumeration pending">*</span>save / query</div>
      <div class="featurebody readMore">The idea is to provide a standardized api for saving and loading data on the class level. <div class="more">Something like save variable; and load by passing the key to the constructor.
